I am a computational social scientist, interested in studying news consumption as a socio-political process. My research areas include the following:

1. Analysis of online audience behavior.

2. Developing computational (network science / data driven) methods for better studying audiences.

3. Running online experiments to understand the microdynamics of news selection.

4. Running online experiments to understand the effects of partisan information consumption on social media.

Check out my publications [here](./../publications).
