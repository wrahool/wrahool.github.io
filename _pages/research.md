I am a computational social scientist, and my research interests lie in using data-driven methods to understand the dynamics of audience behaviour online. My research revolves around the following three distinct, but often interrelated pillars.

1. The analysis of large scale behavioural data to understand collective dynamics of news consumption, as well as the relationship between audience engagement and news production.

2. The development of computational approaches that are grounded in social science theories for better measuring audience behaviour

3. The use of online experiments to understand the micro-dynamics of media consumption, as well as the psychological and behavioural effects of media exposure.
