## Welcome to my personal webspace

I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Communications and New Media](https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/cnm/) of the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/).

A computational social scientist by training, I study the dynamics of audience behavior on online platforms, and the effects they have on audiences at both, a macro, as well as a micro-level. I hold a PhD from the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu) where I was advised by [Dr. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/sandra-gonzalez-bailon-phd). My research has appeared or is forthcoming in journals of international repute such as *Journal of Communication*, *Political Communication*, *The International Journal of Press/Politics*, *Scientific Reports*, *Social Networks* as well as in popular media such as *The Washington Post*. To learn more, check out the [Research](./research) section of this website.

My interest in the field of computational social science stems largely from my love for Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* trilogy from a very young age. As a result, I generally tend to ponder ways in which large scale social phenomena can be usefully and formally modeled.

Research aside, I teach quantitative methods for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as develop and teach data communication courses for the [MSocSci (Communication) program](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/graduate/msocsci-(communication)) at NUS. To learn more, check out the [Teaching](./teaching) section of this website.

I am also the co-organizer of the Singapore chapter of the Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) starting from 2022. If you're a graduate student, postdoc, or an untenured early career faculty and have a more than passing interest in the intersection of social science and data science, [consider applying](https://sicss.io/2022/singapore/)!

In a previous life, I wrote code for analytics start-ups in India. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, and a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Pennsylvania.

I make up for not being very physically active by watching sports. I follow [Formula 1](http://formula1.com/), and am a supporter of [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/). Yes, it's football, not soccer.

I love to read, write, cook, and listen to podcasts, not necessarily in that order.
