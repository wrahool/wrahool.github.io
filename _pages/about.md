## Welcome to my personal webspace

I am a computational social scientist, interested in understanding the relationship between digital technologies  and human behavior. I hold a PhD from the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu) where I was advised by [Dr. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/node/648). To learn more about my doctoral research, check out the [Research](./research) section.

I am headed to Singapore in the Fall of 2020, where I will be joining the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) as Assistant Professor of Computational Communication.

My interest in the field of computational social science stems largely from my love for Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* trilogy from a very young age. As a result, I generally tend to ponder ways in which large scale social phenomena can be usefully and formally modeled.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, and a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Pennsylvania.

I make up for not being very physically active by watching sports. I follow  [Formula 1](http://formula1.com/), and am a supporter of [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/). Yes, it's football, not soccer.

I love to read, write, cook, and listen to podcasts, not necessarily in that order.
