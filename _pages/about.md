## Welcome to my personal webspace

I am a PhD candidate at the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu) where I am advised by [Dr. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/node/648). I am a member of the [DiMeNet research group](http://dimenet.asc.upenn.edu/) and the [DIG working group](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/working-groups/democracy-information-group).

My area of research, broadly construed, is computational social science. To learn more, check out the [Research](./research) section.

My interest in the field of computational social science stems largely from my love for Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* trilogy from a very young age. As a result, I generally tend to ponder ways in which large scale social phenomena can be usefully and formally modeled.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, and a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Pennsylvania.

I make up for not being very physically active by watching sports. I follow  [Formula 1](http://formula1.com/), and am a supporter of [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/). Yes, it's football, not soccer.

I love to read, write, cook, and listen to podcasts, not necessarily in that order.
