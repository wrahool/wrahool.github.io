I am a PhD candidate at the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu).

I am advised by [Dr. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/node/648), and am a member of the [DiMeNet research group](http://dimenet.asc.upenn.edu/") and the [DIG working group](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/working-groups/democracy-information-group).

My area of research, broadly construed, is computational social science. To learn more, check out the [Research](./#research) section below.

My interest in the field of computational social science stems largely from my love for Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* trilogy from a very young age. As a result, I generally tend to ponder ways in which large scale social phenomena can be usefully and formally modeled.

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science, and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics, from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India. As part of my PhD program, I completed a Master of Arts degree in Communication from Penn.

I make up for not being very physically active by watching sports. I follow  [Formula 1](http://formula1.com/), and am a supporter of [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/). Yes, it's football, not soccer.

I love to read, write, and think, not necessarily in that order.

# Research

I am a computational social scientist, interested in studying news consumption as a socio-political process. My research areas include the following:

1. Analysis of online audience behavior.

2. Developing computational (network science / data driven) methods for better studying audiences.

3. Running online experiments to understand the microdynamics of partisan news selection.

4. Running online experiments to understand the effects of partisan information consumption on social media.

Check out my publications [here](./publications).
