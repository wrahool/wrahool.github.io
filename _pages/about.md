## Welcome to my personal webspace

I am an assistant professor at the [Department of Communications and New Media](https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/cnm/) of the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/).

A computational social scientist by training, I study the dynamics of audience behavior on online platforms, and the effects they have on audiences at both, a macro, as well as a micro-level. I hold a Ph.D. from the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) of the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu) where I was advised by [Dr. Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/sandra-gonzalez-bailon-phd). My research has appeared in international social science journals such as *Journal of Communication*, *Political Communication*, *The International Journal of Press/Politics* as well as interdisciplinary venues such as *Scientific Reports*, and *Social Networks*. I have also written about my research for popular media such as *The Washington Post* and *The Indian Express*, and my research has received international media coverage as well. To learn more, check out the [Research](./research) section of this website. For a full list of my publications, visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y7_E1EIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My interest in the field of computational social science stems largely from my love for Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* trilogy from a very young age. As a result, I generally tend to ponder ways in which large scale social phenomena can be usefully and formally modeled.

Research aside, I teach quantitative methods for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as develop and teach data communication courses for the [MSocSci (Communication) program](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/programmes/graduate/msocsci-(communication)) at NUS. You can check out the [Teaching](./teaching) section of this website for further details.

In a previous life, I wrote code for analytics start-ups in India. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, and a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Pennsylvania.

In my spare time, I read, write, cook, listen to podcasts, and watch sports. I enjoy following [Formula 1](http://formula1.com/), and support [Arsenal Football Club](https://www.arsenal.com/) with an aching heart.
