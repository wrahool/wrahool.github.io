Here are some random stuff about me:

- [A list of my favorite books](./../books)
- [A list of my favorite movies](./../movies)
- [A list of my favorite TV shows](./../tv-shows)
- [A list of my favorite podcasts](./../podcasts)
- [My last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/wrahool)

Here is an (incomplete) list of things that I have found interesting/useful:

- [This paper](/files/keshav-read-paper.pdf/) on how to read a paper
- [This lucid illustration](/files/feynman-negative-probabilities.pdf) of negative probabilities by Richard Feynman. It's very useful for understanding why one shouldn't dismiss mathematical results that don't seem interpretable to our common sense
