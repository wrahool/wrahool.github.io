I'm very excited to announce a new co-authored publication in the Journal of Communication. This work, that builds on our [recent paper in Political Communication](https://www.subhayan.com/posts/2022/6/twitterverse-polcom-pub/), offers a timely audit of Twitter's shadowban algorithms between 2020-21, thereby shedding light on (one of) the most contentious issues around social media today. 

Read it [here](https://academic.oup.com/joc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/joc/jqac050/6967119). A Twitter thread summarising the findings can be found [here](https://twitter.com/feedkoko/status/1517160001353428992).
