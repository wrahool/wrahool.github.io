I was invited by [A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), Singapore's foremost public sector research agency, to present my research at their Social Science & Technology Seminar Series. In my talk, titled "Informational Disparities in the Landscape of News Consumption and Production on Digital Platforms," I knit together several recently concluded research projects to discuss the evolving dynamics between digital media and their audiences, and their implications for the future.
