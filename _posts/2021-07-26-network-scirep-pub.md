Excited to have my first solo authored peer-reviewed journal article published today in *Scientific Reports*! This is a methodological paper that formalizes as well as extends some of the more technical network science approaches that I used for my dissertation research, and lays down recommendations for those seeking to analyse audience co-exposure networks.

Find it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94724-1). (open access)
