I was recently invited by Prof. Emese Domahidi (TU Ilmenau) to appear on the [What is it about computational communication science podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ccs-pod/) to talk about the power of platforms. We (Emese, Mario Haim, and myself) talked about the increasingly pervasive role that digital platforms play in mediating our access to information and news, the importance of social media metrics, audience fragmentation, and the need for a global perspective in answering these questions. It was a fun 45 minute conversation, but in the end we were left with more questions than answers.
