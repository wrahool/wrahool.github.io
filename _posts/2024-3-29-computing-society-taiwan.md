I was invited to a workshop titled ["Computing Society"](https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/workshop.php?id=21) held at the Institute of Sociology of Academia Sinica, Taiwan to deliver a talk about my research in particular and the future of computational social science in general. My talk was titled "Informational Asymmetries in the Production and Consumption of Digital Media" ([slide deck](https://www.subhayan.com/assets/files/Subhayan_Academia-Sinica.pdf) / [recording (from around 50 minutes)](https://www.facebook.com/iosacademiasinica/videos/929475851972410/?app=fbl)).

It was my first time visiting Taiwan, and I had a lovely couple of days there, and met some wonderful new colleagues. I hope to go back very soon!
