I was recently invited to deliver a (virtual) guest lecture for [SICSS-Beijing](https://sicss.io/2021/beijing/) where I spoke about using agent-based models and network science in conjunction to understand selective exposure. I'm a big fan of [SICSS](https://sicss.io/), having been an alum of its Chicago chapter in 2019, and so had no hesitation in accepting the invite!

The recording of the talk can be viewed on Zoom [here](https://mit.zoom.us/rec/share/NFMZFMzwvlUqNad_-udqlcHUrW5QCxExUiD-yn0PkCd-mM6aqtccY143ZiOa5UUG.Y6Wce6g_o8AstXWZ?startTime=1623762366000).
