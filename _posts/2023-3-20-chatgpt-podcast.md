I was recently invited to appear on the [CNM podcast (part of NUS' FASSTalk)](https://fasstalk.podbean.com/) to talk about [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). We (Jonathan Sim, NUS Philosophy and myself) talked about what ChatGPT is, its role as a potential "classmate" for students, and how it can enhance academic research and effect change in education. We finally wrapped up the conversation with its sociopolitical implications as well as its impact on human capabilities. A special tip of the hat to my colleague Rosemary Overell for being a wonderful host and steering the conversation adeptly with incisive questions.
