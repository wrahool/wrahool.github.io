There was a man named Pythagoras \\
Who once munched on a chocolatey torus \\
But the sweet sugary excesses \\
Made him middle-part his tresses \\
And he created an equation for us.

On one fine day did Descartes \\
Take the night bus to Stuttgart \\
But the rectangular coordinates of the place \\
Put a grimace on his face \\
With a heavy heart did he depart.
