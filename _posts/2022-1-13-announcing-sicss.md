I am excited to co-organize the inaugural edition of SICSS-Singapore! SICSS (Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science) is a global initiative to bring together graduate students, postdocs and early career faculty members for intensive study and interdisciplinary research in computational social science for a two week period, and SICSS-Singapore will be the first SICSS partner location in the ASEAN region.

Graciously funded by the Centre for Trusted Internet and Community and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at NUS, SICSS-Singapore is aimed at those who wish to explore the intersection of social science and data science.
