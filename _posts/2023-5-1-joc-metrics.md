Super excited to announce (another!) publication in the Journal of Communication - this time in a Special Issue ([Social Media: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly](https://academic.oup.com/joc/pages/cfp-si-social-media-gbu)) with my collaborators Tian Yang (at CUHK) and Yilang Peng (at UGeorgia).

We use a large (N ~ 2.23M) longitudinal dataset of Facebook posts published by American media outlets to understand the effects of  audience engagement (as measured by Facebook metrics) with news topics on the *future* production of news of that topic in subsequent news cycles. Methodologically, this was one of the most demanding papers I've worked on as it required careful statistical controls and a slew of robustness tests to ensure any effects we were estimating captured the signal amid the noise.

Find it [here](https://academic.oup.com/joc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/joc/jqad012/7136724), or if you don't have access, check out the [pre-print](https://osf.io/vcp69/). You can also check out the Twitter summary thread [here](https://twitter.com/wrahool/status/1650169463512375299).
