I was recently invited by the [NUS School of Continuing Lifelong Education (SCALE)](https://scale.nus.edu.sg/) to deliver a masterclass on Data Storytelling for Business as part of the [NUS Lifelong Learning Festival 2022](https://lifelonglearningfestival.nus.edu.sg/?utm_source=SCALE&utm_medium=homepage+banner&utm_campaign=LLF2022). The focus of this edition of the festival was the Future of Work in Singapore. 

The audience of my talk comprised industry experts, government officials and academics, some of whom were present physically, while others joined the session online. The recording is now [available for viewing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlyzrF14Z74) (my talk runs from the beginning to about the 30 minute mark. Brownie points if you can identify the one mistake I made :))
