Legend has it that when Sissa Ben Dahir invented the game of *chaturanga*, the precursor to what is today known as chess, in ancient India, the king was so impressed that he asked Sissa to name any reward for his invention. Sissa requested the following: "Just one grain of wheat on the first square of the board. Then put two on the second square, four on the next, then eight, and continue, doubling the number of grains on each successive square, until every square is reached." The king, though bemused at the oddity of this request, immediately ordered his courtiers to ensure that the required number of grains was given to Sissa. It was only a little later that the king was informed that the task was impossible. In fact, as his court mathematicians told him, there wasn't enough land area in the whole of the world to grow the amount of wheat - 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains - that Sissa had requested.

This legend, while illustrating how bad people generally are at understanding exponential growth, is of particular relevance to the task I have at hand - that of writing the acknowledgements section of my dissertation. I am the ancient Indian king, blissfully unaware of his own naiveté, all the while expecting a problem to be tractable, when it actually isn't. In other words, acknowledging *everyone* who made this dissertation possible is a futile exercise. I recognize the hidden, often random ways in which people succeed, and if my getting a Ph.D. is any measure of personal success, I owe it to the countably immeasurable number of people who have touched my life for the better, and who deserve my deepest gratitude for where I am today. I am indeed sorry that I cannot name every single one of you individually.

Turning the clock back to the fall of 2014: I was a confused bloke in my mid 20s, having a very vague aim in life to do research in some capacity - preferably in a Ph.D. program. But I didn't know where to start. Sure, I had taken my GRE and TOEFL exams. But what next? What did I even want to study? Thus, when I sent out a hundred emails to a number of professors craving for a slice of their attention, little did I expect anything to really materialize. So I was pleasantly surprised, not to mention, relieved, when I heard back from a certain Prof. Sandra González-Bailón, who urged me to apply to the Ph.D. program at the Annenberg School at Penn. A year later, I would be in said Ph.D. program, fumbling around trying to make sense of this alien thing called "Communication", and Prof. Sandra González-Bailón would be my advisor.

To put it bluntly: this Ph.D. would not have happened without her. She was instrumental in my transition to the social sciences, and helped me in countless ways in making sense of this bewildering new discipline that I found myself thrust into. Sandra has been the most amazing mentor I could have hoped for, and I feel thankful to have had her support along what would otherwise have been a far more arduous journey. As someone who is about to begin his career in academia, I will strive to do for my future students, what she has done for me - always enabling me to aim higher and do better.

Next, I would like to thank my committee, for being so incredibly helpful and encouraging over the past several years:

Prof. Yphtach Lelkes - for being this limitless repository of academic knowledge, and dispenser of citations-on-the-go. Knowing Yph has been like turning on a faucet of research advice - and relevant citations, and I regret not getting to know him earlier than I did. Literature reviews are definitely easy when you have Yph on your side.

Prof. Joe Turow - for always being so incredibly illuminating in every conversation I have had with him - be it, in his office or while waiting for a flight at Prague airport. I have learnt so much from him, and I can only aspire to achieve the level of authority in my field that he has achieved in his. I would also like to thank him for offering a rare course on the history of media research during my time at Annenberg, a course that has been most helpful for me at a personal level.

Prof. Michael Delli Carpini - for always taking time out of his extraordinarily busy schedule as the former Dean - to respond to every email no matter how trite, to have in-person meetings, and even go out for lunch! He has been a model to emulate when it comes to balancing an incredibly high level of intellect with administrative acumen and personal affability. I feel truly thankful for knowing him over the past several years.

I would also like to thank Prof. Robert Hornik, Prof. Joe Cappella, and Prof. Marwan Kraidy for being significant sources of inspiration, instruction, and help along the way. Many of the things I learned in their classes have found direct application in my doctoral research, and for that, I am thankful.

It would be remiss to not acknowledge the entire staff at the Annenberg school for being the silent heroes behind every dissertation. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Joanne Murray for being who she is. The more I hear about the logistical and administrative travails of international graduate students in other programs and universities, the more I feel grateful to Joanne for being there to iron out all glitches that I have faced. Also, special thanks to the entire IT and library staff, particularly Etienne Jacquot, Andreas Spillari, Elizabeth Cooper, and Sharon Black.
