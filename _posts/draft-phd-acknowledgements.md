Legend has it that when Sissa Ben Dahir invented the game of *chaturanga*, the precursor to what is today known as chess, in ancient India, the king was so impressed that he asked Sissa to name any reward for his invention. Sissa requested the following: "Just one grain of wheat on the first square of the board. Then put two on the second square, four on the next, then eight, and continue, doubling the number of grains on each successive square, until every square is reached." The king, though bemused at the oddity of this request, immediately ordered his courtiers to ensure that the required number of grains was given to Sissa. It was only a little later that the king was informed that the task was impossible. In fact, as his court mathematicians told him, there wasn't enough land area in the whole of the world to grow the amount of wheat - 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains - that Sissa had requested.

This legend, while illustrating how bad people generally are at understanding exponential growth, is of particular relevance to the task I have at hand - that of writing the acknowledgements section of my dissertation. I am the ancient Indian king, blissfully unaware of his own naiveté, all the while expecting a problem to be tractable, when it actually isn't. In other words, acknowledging *everyone* who made this dissertation possible is a futile exercise. I recognize the hidden, often random ways in which people succeed, and if my getting a Ph.D. is any measure of personal success, I owe it to the countably immeasurable number of people who have touched my life for the better, and who deserve my deepest gratitude for where I am today. I am indeed sorry that I cannot name every single one of you individually.

Turning the clock back to the fall of 2014: I was a confused bloke in my mid 20s, having a very vague aim in life to do research in some capacity - preferably in a Ph.D. program. But I didn't know where to start. Sure, I had taken my GRE and TOEFL exams. But what next? What did I even want to study? Thus, when I sent out a hundred emails to a number of professors craving for a slice of their attention, little did I expect anything to really materialize. So I was pleasantly surprised, not to mention, relieved, when I heard back from a certain Prof. Sandra González-Bailón, who urged me to apply to the Ph.D. program at the Annenberg School at Penn. A year later, I would be in said Ph.D. program, fumbling around trying to make sense of this alien thing called "Communication", and Prof. Sandra González-Bailón would be my advisor.

To put it bluntly: this Ph.D. would not have happened without her. She was instrumental in my transition to the social sciences, helped me make sense of this bewildering new discipline (I didn't know what ICA was, for exam Sandra has been the most amazing mentor I could have hoped for, and I feel thankful to have had her support along what would have otherwise been a much more arduous path.
