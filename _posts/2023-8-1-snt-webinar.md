I was recently invited by the [Smart Nation and Digital Governance Office (SNDGO)](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/about-smart-nation/sndgg/) under the [Prime Minister's Office (PMO)](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/) to deliver an online webinar as part of the [Smart Nation Together initiative](https://together.smartnation.gov.sg/). The topic of the webinar was Power of Data Analytics and AI for Positive Change.

The audience of my talk comprised industry experts, government officials and academics. The recording is now [available for viewing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAzQY3Czv4))
