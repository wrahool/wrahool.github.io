I delivered a public seminar at the [NUS Centre for Trusted Internet and Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) where I talked about my recent research on metrics and journalism that was [published in the Journal of Communication](https://www.subhayan.com/posts/2023/4/joc-metrics/). 

The session was moderated by my NUS colleague [Dr. Shangyuan Wu](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/cnmws/) and attended by students, other NUS staff, and members of the public.
