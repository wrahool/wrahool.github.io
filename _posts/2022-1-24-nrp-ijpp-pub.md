Last week, the theory chapter from my Ph.D. dissertation was published by *The International Journal of Press/Politics*. In this paper, I introduce a conceptual framework called "News Reading Publics" which I argue, helps us understand the audience fragmentation of national news reading populations outside western contexts.

Find it [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19401612211072700) (or hit me up for ungated access).
