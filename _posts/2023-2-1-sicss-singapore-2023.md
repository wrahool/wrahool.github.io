I am super excited that SICSS is returning to Singapore in 2023 for its second edition! [SICSS](https://sicss.io/) (Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science) is a global initiative to bring together graduate students, postdocs and early career faculty members for intensive study and interdisciplinary research in computational social science.

Graciously funded and hosted by the Centre for Trusted Internet and Community, SICSS-Singapore is aimed at those who wish to explore the intersection of social science and data science. For details visit the [SICSS-Singapore website](https://sicss.io/2023/singapore/).
