Last week, the empirical findings from my Ph.D. dissertation was published by *Information, Communication & Society*. In this paper, I introduce a concept called "Audience Mobility" to investigate longitudinal changes in India's online news consumption landscape. It's hard to find journals willing to publish research which is ostensibly about non-Western contexts, and so I'm glad that after several rejections for over 2 years, this piece found utterance at ICS.
