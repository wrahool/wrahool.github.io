This is my first blog post on GitHub Pages!

I will subsequently be transitioning away from my previous Blogger based web-blog at <https://blog.subhayan.com/> to this site which is hosted on GitHub pages.

I had started my Blogger blog back in 2009, when I was an 18-year old nobody. It's been 11 long years since then (which in hindsight does not seem particularly long). Personally however, this feels like the end of an era - as the blog has been one of the few constants that has stayed by my side for what has undeniably been the most formative decade of my life.

The above URL will still work, but I will not be updating that blog any longer. I hope to occasionally pen down my thoughts here from now on.

So long, Blogger, and thanks for all the fish.
