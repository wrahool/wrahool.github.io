Last month, we successfully organised an [International Communication Association preconference titled "A Comutational Turn in Journalism"](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/ica-2024/). This hybrid day-long event, hosted by the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of NUS, saw 30 presentations from scholars around the world over 3 sets of parallel sessions. We were also lucky to have two in-person keynotes by renowned experts studying the intersection of journalism and computation. See the full preconference program [here](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Preconference-Program-Final_20240617.pdf).
