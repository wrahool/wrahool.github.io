One block away from our apartment on W Polk Street in Chicago was *Jarabe*, arguably the - indulge me for a moment - greatest Mexican street food place in the world. When they first opened shop back in 2016, my taste in Mexican food was limited to the few places in and around University City in West Philadelphia. *Ugly Delicious* hadn't begun streaming on Netflix, so South Philly Barbacoa was still unknown to me.

When one hears about Chicago, a city known for its unhealthy obsession for cheesy casseroles masquerading as pizzas, good Mexican food is not what comes to mind. But it was in this unlikely city that I discovered the magic the cuisine had to offer. Jarabe was everything you needed your go-to place to be: it was inexpensive, it was convenient, and the food was frakking amazing. As a result, when I moved into the city in the summer of 2018, *Jarabe* became this quiet source of comfort when our Ph.D. lives came in the way of our cooking. You knew you could rely on *Jarabe* if you didn't have food in the house: that their chicken tinga would be there to throw you a line when you were drowning in the rejections that inundated your inbox; that their birria would be as tender as academia could be dry.
