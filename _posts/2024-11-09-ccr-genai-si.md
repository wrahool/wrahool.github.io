[Alvin Zhou](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/alvinyxz), [Ewa Maslowska](https://media.illinois.edu/advertising/maslowska-ewa), and I are guest-editing a special issue on ``Generative AI in Computational Communication Research'' for the journal [Computational Communication Research](https://journal.computationalcommunication.org/). The special issue aims to bring together cutting-edge research that either focuses on generative AI as a communication phenomenon, or substantively uses generative AI to study communication processes. The full call for papers can be found [here](https://z.umn.edu/ccrgenai).

Extended abstracts are due 31 December 2024. Full papers for shortlisted abstracts will be due for peer review on 30 April 2025.
