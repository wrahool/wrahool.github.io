Legend has it that when Sissa Ben Dahir invented the game of *chaturanga*, the precursor to what is today known as chess, in ancient India, the king was so impressed that he asked Sissa to name any reward for his invention. Sissa requested the following: "Just one grain of wheat on the first square of the board. Then put two on the second square, four on the next, then eight, and continue, doubling the number of grains on each successive square, until every square on the chessboard is reached." The king was though, bemused ordered the required number of grains of wheat to be disbursed to Sissa. It was only a little later that he got to know that that final number was so large that there wasn't enough land area in the whole of the world to grow the amount of wheat that Sissa had requested.
