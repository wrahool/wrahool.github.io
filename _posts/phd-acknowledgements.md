Legend has it that when Sissa Ben Dahir invented the game of *chaturanga*, the precursor to what is today known as chess, in ancient India, the king was so impressed that he asked Sissa to name any reward for his invention. Sissa requested the following: "Just one grain of wheat on the first square of the board. Then put two on the second square, four on the next, then eight, and continue, doubling the number of grains on each successive square, until every square is reached." The king, though bemused at the oddity of this request, immediately ordered his courtiers to ensure that the required number of grains was given to Sissa. It was only a little later that the king was informed that the task was impossible. In fact, as his court mathematicians told him, there wasn't enough land area in the whole of the world to grow the amount of wheat - 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains - that Sissa had requested.

This legend, while illustrating how bad people generally are at understanding exponential growth, is of particular relevance to the task I have at hand - that of writing the acknowledgements section of my Ph.D. dissertation. I am the foolish ancient Indian king blissfully unaware  a virtually impossible task whose immensity that I so grossly underestimated
