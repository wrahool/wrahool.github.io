I am super excited to announce that my colleagues and I are organising an ICA preconference titled ["A Computational Turn in Journalism: Opportunities and Challenges in a Cross-Dsiciplinary Field"](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/ica-2024/) in Singapore! We welcome submissions from those who are conducting research at the intersection of computational methods and journalism. Read the full CFP [here](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/ica-2024/) and submit your abstracts by January 26!
